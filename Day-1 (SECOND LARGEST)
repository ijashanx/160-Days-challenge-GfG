## QUESTION  

Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. 
If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

TEST CASES :- 

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.

Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

## CODE 

class Solution {
public:
    int getSecondLargest(vector<int>& arr) {
        int max = INT_MIN; 
        int smax = INT_MIN; 
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num > max) {
                smax = max; 
                max = num;  
            } else if (num > smax && num != max) {
                smax = num; 
            }
        }
        return (smax == INT_MIN) ? -1 : smax;
    }
};
